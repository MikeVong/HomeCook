ABOUT:
With Covid-19 closing down a lot of restaurants and jobs in the U.S., people have lost their source of income and those who dine out often have been left with having to make their own meals. 

Here at Home-cooks, we have created a solution to feed the masses while starting up temporary jobs for anyone that knows how to cook. Introducing the Home-Cooks website: where chefs can post dishes of their creations for anyone to purchase. Just open up the webpage, select whether you are a cook or an eater. 
If you’ve selected Cooks, you will be asked to enter in the dish information, time and date when it will be ready, where to meet, and the payment type of your preference. If you’ve selected Eaters, you will be taken to the Google Maps page that displays all of the dishes in your area (with the information the cooks have provided), and you can select the amount of portions that you would like. 

And there you have it! A solution that will create new jobs and bring back the ability for people to eat dishes made by others.

APP OVERVIEW:
1. 

HOW TO USE:
1. Once on the homepage, click on the get started button on the upper right hand corner and you will be brought down to the choices section. Select 'Cook' if you would like to post a dish you've made, or select 'Eat' if you are looking for a dish to buy. Users can scroll to the bottom of the page and play the audio that is on the page, if they choose.

2. COOKS PAGE: Fill out the form and submit it once completed. A modal will pop up, letting the user know that their dish has been posted and they will be contacted via email once someone has purchased their dish. Once the user closes the modal, the user will be redirected to the homepage.

3. EAT PAGE: Users will be directed to the Google Maps page that shows the area of their current location, if they agree to allowing the Geo Location app to use their location. There, they will be able to view all the dishes that are for sale near them, including the address to pick up the dish, an image of the dish, the cook's name, and its price . By clicking on the dish cards on the map, users will be prompt to an 'Add to Cart' button. Once clicked on, they will be directed to the details page, displaying all of that information, including the cook's email address.

4. Once the dish has been added to cart, users can go to their cart and check out their dish. Users can add as many dishes as they want to their cart and can compare and remove the dishes that they don't want. Users are only allowed to purchase one dish at a time, similar to Uber Eats, Doordash, and other food delivery services. Once they have hit the checkout button on the dish's card, a modal will pop up, letting them know that their dish will be ready in 45 minutes at it's designated location for pickup.
